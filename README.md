# Portfolio
Here you will see a sampling of my research papers, projects, and case studies while in attendance at Southern Methodist University's Master of Data Science program. The data sets and domains are varied ranging from flu outcomes, mortgage loans, web-scraping, vehicle MPG, to stock market equities tick data.

These are just a sample of the analysis performed and data worked with throughout the completion of the MSDS program at SMU. I will soon post a link to a research paper entitled "Machine Learning to Predict College Course Success" which was completed as our final capstone project and will change how college admission departments view current standardized practices. Therein you will learn how machine learning can provide a drastic improvement over current standardized testing models.
